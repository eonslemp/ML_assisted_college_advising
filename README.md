## Machine Learning Assisted College Advising
   Every year millions of high school students enroll in college.  About 40% of these students will not graduate.  Dropping out of college is a demoralizing and expensive way to start adulthood.  The average college dropout incurs about 13,000 dollars in debt.  About 50% of these students will default on this debt.  These financial considerations are beside the difficult to quantify psychological effects that can come from the subtle indoctrination that a university credential is a prerequisite for success, and the potentially life altering knowledge that they have failed to achieve this prerequisite.  The purpose of this study is to develop a data based exploration of college success to reveal the core traits of a successful college student, and build a machine learning model predicting college graduation.  These predictions must only use data that can be known about the student at the time of high school graduation.  This analysis reveals three key features of a successful college student.  Successful college students have standardized test scores, most importantly math scores, that are on average about one standard deviation above their peers, they have strong high school grade point averages, and have confidence in their ability to actualize academically.  Currently a guidance counselor has to rely on intuition that might be muddled by myriad sources of well intentioned bias.  A machine learning model can take a student's data and provide a more definitive answer on how well prepared a student is for college.  By using the results of the model a guidance counselor can, with increased precision, advise a student on where they stand, and then use this knowledge with a more holistic understanding of a student's situation to advise a path forward that is grounded in data.  

###  The Data
   This analysis uses the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002.  The Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 followed about 16000 people over ten year period starting in their sophomore year of high school through three follow up data collections over the next decade of the individual's life.  The first follow up is in the student's senior year of high school, a second follow up two years after high school graduation, and the third follow up in 2012, or at about the age 26.   The entire dataset has about 5000 features made up of information collected from questionnaires, academic performance data supplied by the school, and other means of collection.  Much of this data is restricted in the public release version of the study.  From the publicly available data I have chosen 31 features.  These features have information on things like standardized test scores, screen time, home life, discipline, and extracurricular activities. For a more complete breakdown of the features used in my analysis see the markdown file titled [features.md](https://github.com/eonslemp/ML_assisted_college_advising/blob/master/features.md) in this repository, or to access the original study click on this link to the online [codebook](https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook/Session/Codebook/464e26ac-050e-4cc2-9347-1297cf285b4f).   My analysis takes data from the base year and the first follow up.  These data correspond to the student's sophomore and senior year of high school respectively and provide a snapshot of the student at the point just before college enrollment. The college outcome data comes from the third follow up.  Understanding and predicting these outcomes is the objective of this study.
   
### Methods
   This analysis uses some basic statistics, visual explorations, and classification algorithms to gain insight into successful college students and predict college graduation.  Algorithms used in the modeling are random forest, logistic regression, xgboost, gaussian naive bayes, and KNN.  The purpose of the modeling is to correctly identify the green in the following scatterplot:<br>

### Results
   Using fewer features provides insight into what is most important for college success.  A gaussian naive bayes model with a three feature dataset was able predict with an almost .75  recall score and about .65 F1 score.  This dataset's features were mathematical facility, high school GPA, and educational confidence.  The 'mathematical facility' feature is the product of the student's math standardized test score and an ordinal value corresponding to the highest math class completed in high school.  'educational confidence' is a feature in the original study, and is an ordinal value corresponding to the highest academic achievement the student expects to complete.  High school GPA, as reported in the public release version of the study is an integer value between 1 and 6 that reflects an approximation of the decimal value of grade point average.  This quality is reflected in the horizontal stratification in the above scatterplot. Also note that the 3 features in the modeling dataset are not the same 3 features represented by the axes in the above scatterplot.  The modeling set has two features that are ordinal values and when visualized are difficult to interpret.  The above visualized three features yield a more interpretable way to understand a complex phenomenon.  Below is a scatterplot of the three feature dataset used in the modeling. Notice the cluster of green that appears at points 6, 7, and 8 along the 'Educational Confidence' axis.  These values correspond to 'complete a bachelors degree', 'complete a masters degree', and 'complete a PhD' respectively. Point '9'  was corresponds to the 'unsure' option in the original survey and, consequently few green points.<br>

   This study reveals what may seem obvious. Successful college students have verbal and mathematical standardized test scores that are, on average, about one standard deviation above their peers; however, it is important to note that non-college graduates populate the full range of ability as measured by the standardized testing.

Specifically, mathematical reasoning ability gives the student an advantage in both college performance and in the economy.

Successful college students are disciplined, in that they control hedonic pursuits like video game/movies/tv etc ... and invest time outside of class on homework.

'educational confidence' was a feature that came out of the modeling, that I had included reluctantly in the original feature selection. I expected it to be of minor importance for this task.  It is defined in the study as the highest academic achievement the student expects to complete and is self reported.  Feature importance functions twice identified this feature as one of the most useful features for correct classification. This feature is now the most interesting data in this analysis to me, as one can imagine that packed within it, like a Russian nesting doll, are millions of pieces of information that the student has been logging since childhood.  Data that is then filtered through the subjective prism of the student's self assessment.  This data informs a sense of academic self efficacy that emerges in the form of an ordinal value in this study.  Whether the relationship between college success is causative or correlative cannot be determined here, but intuition leads me to think that its nature is correlation.  Meaning that it would be unlikely that some kind of intervention designed to condition high academic goals, outside of commensurate academic achievement, will be effective; however, this conclusion cannot be properly supported from this study.

Successful college completers also tended to have fewer risk factors present in their home environment.  Risk factors, as defined by the study, are things like household income below the poverty level, frequent school changes, broken family structure, or low educational achievement on the part of the parents.

Lastly, this exploration identified high school grade point average as being useful for correct classification. 

Model performance metrics improved slightly with tuning.  My baseline model was a random forest trained on a data set that had, including dummy variables, 67 features.  This model yielded an F1 score of .6021.  An extensive modeling process yielded my best model, which is a gaussian naive bayes trained on a data set that had only 3 features.  This model yielded an F1 score of 0.6511 with a recall score of .7405.   During the modeling process I worked with the random forest, logistic regression, xgboost, gaussian naive bayes, and KNN algorithms.  F1 score tended to improve from high .50's to low to mid .60's with tuning and feature optimization for most models.  The Best F1 score came from gaussian naive bayes at about .65.  I achieved best precision metric with logistic regression at .6204, and best recall with gaussian naive bayes at .7405 of college completers correctly classified.  


The following curves are precision/ recall trade off curves for the best performing models:

College dropout rate is about 40%, or in other terms, colleges correctly classify about 60% of applicants that were admitted and did attend with their admissions process.  While the classification task performed in this analysis is similar to, it is not precisely comparable to the classification done by colleges.  The modeling in my study correctly classifies about 75% of students that would go on to graduate college.   Here is the confusion matrix of my best model:

![confusion](images/gnb_3.png)

205 students were incorrectly classified as likely dropouts and 422 student were incorrectly classified as likely graduates. With almost twice as many false positives as false negatives, the model tends to err on the overpredicting college success.

### Conclusions

Successful college students have verbal and mathematical standardized test scores that are, on average 1 standard deviation or more above their peers. Specifically, mathematical reasoning ability gives the student a particular advantage in completing a college degree... and ultimately in the economy.   Successful college students are disciplined, in that they limit hedonic pursuits, and invest significant time outside of class on homework.  They tend to come from a home environment that is low in risk factors like broken family structure, frequent changes in school, or poverty and has reading material readily available. Finally, they tend to have a track record of high academic achievement as evidenced by their high school grade point average.  This insight is not paradigm shifting by itself, but does represent a useful qualitative understanding of what factors tend to support success in college.  

A guidance counselor can use this analysis, and modeling together with a more holistic understanding of the student's situation to help guide the student to a more rational decision.  A student with robust financial support, but marginal qualifications may still find utility in college enrollment, as they will be protected from financial catastrophe in the event of dropout.   A student lacking some clearly defined vocational goal and excellent metrics as defined by the study, but in a more precarious financial situation may defer college admission until he achieves more clarity about the future.  A student that is highly motivated for a vocation that requires a college credential, like medicine or engineering, but borderline on or non-selected by the modeling, can be counseled about the risks involved and amount of commitment required to bring these aspirations to fruit.  College advising is an art and this study cannot take the art out this process, but it can provide useful feedback on the probability of success that is superior to the probability of success implied by an acceptance letter. With this knowledge and a holistic understanding of the student, these findings can enhance the decision making process for guidance counselors and high school seniors.  This study is not designed to take the art out of this process, but enhance the state of the art by grounding an assessment of the situation in data.  With an F1 of .65 the modeling does not in and of itself represent a rock solid recommendation; however, it does provide a useful data point. This improved methodology, of combining knowledge of college success, predictive modeling and personal knowledge about the student provides a better foundation from which to build a post-secondary plan for the student.


### Next Steps
**Dashboard deployment** - Build an interface that can take data and return a classification.<br>
**Deeper Statistical Exploration** - A more sophisticated exploratory statistical analysis might yield more insight into some of the peculiarities noted in the EDA. <br>
**Study 'false negatives' and 'false positives'** - A detailed look at students that were classified as 'false negative' or 'false positive' quadrants of the confusion matrix by the model.<br>
**ROI** - Build out a model of college return-on-investment.  
**Neural Network** - Implement a neural network.<br>
**Multi-class** - If a deep learning application can yield improved performance metrics then it may be possible to identify students best suited to four year college, community college, and trade school.
